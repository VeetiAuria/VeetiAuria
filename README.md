👋 Hello World! I'm [Veeti Auria], a passionate learner and aspiring developer currently navigating the exciting world of coding in school. 🚀

🎓 I'm a student, diving deep into the realms of programming and software development. My current focus is on mastering the trifecta of web development: **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.

💻 My coding journey is a work in progress, and I'm enthusiastic about building projects that not only sharpen my skills but also contribute to the tech community.

🌐 Aspiring to make a mark in the digital landscape, I'm particularly keen on web technologies, and you'll often find me experimenting with the latest frameworks and libraries.

🚀 Let's connect, collaborate, and code together! Open to learning, contributing, and exploring the endless possibilities of the coding universe. 🤝
