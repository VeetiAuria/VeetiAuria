ðŸ‘‹ Hello World! I'm Veeti Auria, a passionate learner and aspiring developer currently navigating the exciting world of coding in school. ðŸš€

ðŸŽ“ I'm a student, diving deep into the realms of programming and software development. My current focus is on mastering the trifecta of web development: **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.
